# Monitoring Guidelines

## Key Metrics

### Memory Metrics
- Heap Usage
- Stack Usage
- Record Batch Size
- Active Allocations
- Memory High Watermark

### Network Metrics
- Bytes Downloaded/Uploaded
- Active Connections
- Network Latency
- Bandwidth Utilization
- Request/Response Times

### Processing Metrics
- Records Processed/Second
- Batch Processing Time
- Filter Application Time
- Format Conversion Time
- End-to-End Processing Time

## Implementation Recommendations

### Logging Strategy
- Use structured logging with levels
- Include correlation IDs
- Log memory usage at batch boundaries
- Track timing for each processing phase

### Metric Collection
- Implement prometheus metrics
- Track histograms for timing operations
- Count total bytes processed
- Monitor memory allocation patterns

### Health Checks
- Network connectivity status
- Storage backend availability
- Memory pressure indicators
- Processing pipeline status

## Alert Thresholds

- Memory Usage: Alert at 80% of configured limit
- Processing Time: Alert if >2x average processing time
- Error Rate: Alert if >1% of requests fail
- Network: Alert if utilization drops below 50% expected

## Dashboard Components

1. Resource Usage
   - Memory usage over time
   - Network bandwidth utilization
   - CPU usage (should be minimal)

2. Processing Statistics
   - Records processed per second
   - Average batch processing time
   - Error rates and types

3. Storage Metrics
   - Read/Write latency
   - Storage operation success rate
   - Bandwidth utilization per storage backend
