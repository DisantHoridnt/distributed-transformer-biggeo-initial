# Performance Requirements and Guidelines

## Core Requirements

1. Network-Bound Operations
   - The service should be primarily network-bound rather than CPU or memory-bound
   - Performance should scale primarily with network bandwidth
   - Network operations should be the primary bottleneck

2. Predictable Performance
   - Operations should have consistent timing for similar-sized datasets
   - Resource usage should be proportional to the streaming chunk size, not the total file size
   - Performance should degrade gracefully under load

3. Memory Efficiency
   - Streaming-first approach for all operations
   - No full file buffering in memory
   - Configurable batch sizes for processing

## Implementation Guidelines

### Streaming Implementation
- Use `futures::Stream` for all data processing operations
- Process data in configurable chunk sizes (default: 64KB for network operations)
- Implement backpressure mechanisms to prevent memory overflow

### Memory Management
- Set clear upper bounds for batch sizes
- Implement memory monitoring for record batches
- Use Arrow's zero-copy operations where possible
- Maintain a fixed memory window for processing

### Network Optimization
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Use range requests for cloud storage (S3) operations
- Enable parallel downloads for independent chunks where applicable
- Configure appropriate TCP buffer sizes for network operations

## Monitoring Metrics

Key metrics to track:
1. Memory usage per batch
2. Network throughput
3. Processing latency
4. Batch processing time
5. Total operation time
6. Memory high watermark

## Performance Targets

- Memory Usage: Should not exceed 2x the batch size
- Streaming Latency: First byte response within 100ms
- Batch Processing: Linear scaling with batch size
- Network Utilization: >80% of available bandwidth
